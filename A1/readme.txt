To run the program submission_Mooney-Caitlin-A1.py, run it with following specifications:
Input:
    - The maximum size of the queue (the frontier) used in the breadth-first search.
    -  The value of some kind of parameter (e.g. maximum depth; maximum number of states;
     maximum run time) that will to prevent the program from going into an infinite loop.
      Note that the program can go into an infinite loop either in stage 2 or in stage 1,
       if the search can proceed without exhausting the queue, so the limit must apply to both stages.
    - (*) A flag indicating the type of output, as described in the next section
(Output).
    - The number of Dominoes.
    - The set of dominos.
Notes:
I included an old file version I worked on that I had given up on, called Mooney-Caitlin-A1.py.

Additional Notes:
This file may be wonky, I apologize.  I also used some home alone references for fun.
